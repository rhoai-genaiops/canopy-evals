  # Technical Content
  - prompt: "Artificial intelligence and machine learning have revolutionized numerous industries in recent years. From healthcare diagnostics that can detect diseases earlier than human doctors, to autonomous vehicles that promise safer transportation, to recommendation systems that personalize our digital experiences, AI technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated. However, these advances also bring challenges including ethical concerns about bias in algorithms, job displacement due to automation, and the need for robust data privacy protections."
    expected_result: "AI and ML have transformed industries through healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, and recommendation systems, but also raise concerns about bias, job displacement, and privacy."

  # News Article Style
  - prompt: "The Federal Reserve announced today a 0.25% interest rate increase, bringing the federal funds rate to 5.5%, its highest level in over two decades. The decision was driven by persistent inflation concerns, with consumer prices rising 3.7% year-over-year in the latest report. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the central bank remains committed to bringing inflation down to its 2% target, even if it means accepting some economic slowdown. Financial markets reacted positively to the news, with major indices closing up 1-2% as investors welcomed the measured approach."
    expected_result: "The Fed raised interest rates by 0.25% to 5.5% to combat 3.7% inflation, with markets responding positively to the measured approach toward the 2% inflation target."

  # Scientific Research
  - prompt: "A groundbreaking study published in Nature reveals that certain gut bacteria can influence cognitive function and memory formation in mice. Researchers at Stanford University found that mice with depleted gut microbiomes showed significant impairments in spatial memory tasks compared to control groups. The study involved 200 laboratory mice over 12 weeks, using advanced sequencing techniques to analyze bacterial populations. When beneficial bacteria were reintroduced through fecal transplants, cognitive performance improved within 4 weeks. This research suggests a direct gut-brain axis that could have implications for treating neurodegenerative diseases in humans."
    expected_result: "Stanford researchers found that gut bacteria directly affect cognitive function and memory in mice, with bacterial depletion impairing performance and restoration improving it, suggesting potential treatments for human neurodegenerative diseases."

  # Business Content
  - prompt: "Tesla reported record quarterly earnings of $23.4 billion in revenue, exceeding analyst expectations by 8%. The electric vehicle manufacturer delivered 466,000 vehicles in Q3, up 35% from the previous year. CEO Elon Musk attributed the strong performance to increased production efficiency at the company's Austin and Berlin gigafactories, as well as growing demand in Asian markets. Despite the positive results, Tesla stock fell 3% in after-hours trading as investors remained concerned about increased competition from traditional automakers entering the EV space."
    expected_result: "Tesla beat earnings expectations with $23.4B revenue and 466,000 vehicle deliveries, but stock fell 3% due to EV competition concerns despite strong Asian demand and improved production efficiency."

  # Historical Event
  - prompt: "The Berlin Wall, constructed in 1961, stood as a symbol of the Cold War division between East and West Germany for 28 years. Built by the German Democratic Republic to prevent East Germans from fleeing to the West, the wall stretched 96 miles around West Berlin. Families were separated overnight, and numerous escape attempts resulted in tragic deaths. The wall's fall on November 9, 1989, marked the beginning of German reunification and symbolized the end of the Cold War era. Today, remnants of the wall serve as a memorial and reminder of this pivotal period in history."
    expected_result: "The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to stop East German escapes, divided families for 28 years until its fall in 1989 marked German reunification and the Cold War's end."

  # Environmental Topic
  - prompt: "Climate scientists warn that Arctic sea ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, with 2023 showing the second-lowest ice coverage on record. Satellite data indicates that ice extent has declined by 13% per decade since 1979, contributing to rising sea levels and disrupting Arctic ecosystems. Polar bears, seals, and other wildlife face habitat loss, while indigenous communities must adapt their traditional hunting practices. The reduced ice coverage also creates a feedback loop, as darker ocean water absorbs more heat than reflective ice, accelerating the warming process."
    expected_result: "Arctic sea ice is melting at record rates, declining 13% per decade since 1979, threatening wildlife and indigenous communities while accelerating warming through reduced heat reflection."

  # Technology Explanation
  - prompt: "Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift from classical computing by utilizing quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement. While classical computers process information in binary bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or 'qubits' that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, particularly in areas like cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems. However, quantum computers are extremely sensitive to environmental interference and require near-absolute zero temperatures to function properly."
    expected_result: "Quantum computing uses qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling exponentially faster calculations than classical computers for cryptography and optimization, but requires extremely cold temperatures to operate."

  # Medical Content
  - prompt: "Researchers have developed a new immunotherapy treatment that shows promising results for treating pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer with a five-year survival rate of only 11%. The treatment combines CAR-T cell therapy with checkpoint inhibitors to help the immune system better recognize and attack cancer cells. In clinical trials involving 150 patients, the combination therapy extended median survival from 6 months to 14 months. While side effects include fatigue and immune-related complications, the treatment offers hope for patients with limited options."
    expected_result: "New immunotherapy combining CAR-T cells and checkpoint inhibitors extended pancreatic cancer survival from 6 to 14 months in trials, offering hope for a disease with 11% five-year survival rate."

  # Educational Content  
  - prompt: "Photosynthesis is the biological process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process occurs in two main stages: light-dependent reactions in the thylakoids and light-independent reactions in the stroma of chloroplasts. During photosynthesis, six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water react in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight to produce one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen. This process is essential for life on Earth as it produces the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of most food chains."
    expected_result: "Photosynthesis converts sunlight into chemical energy through light-dependent and light-independent reactions, producing glucose and oxygen from CO2 and water, forming the foundation of Earth's food chains."

  # Short Technical Description
  - prompt: "Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks."
    expected_result: "ML algorithms automatically learn data patterns without explicit programming."

  # Simple Current Event
  - prompt: "The World Health Organization declared the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency in May 2023, marking a significant milestone after more than three years of global pandemic response."
    expected_result: "WHO ended the COVID-19 public health emergency in May 2023 after over three years of pandemic response."
